# âš½ Football Match Sport Analysis  

This project focuses on **automatic football (soccer) match analysis** using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**.  
The system can detect players and the ball, assign ball possession, classify teams based on jersey colors, and transform the match view into a tactical top-view for better analysis.
